        <h1>INDIAN MYTHOLOGY</h1>
        <p>Hinduism is an Indian religion and dharma, which means way of life. It is currently the world's third largest religion. The term Hindu was first used as a geographical, and later an ethno-cultural, term to refer to the Indian continent and its people. The word Hinduism was first used to refer to the religious and philosophical traditions native to India by English colonists in the 18th century. Many followers of Hinduism refer to the religion as Santana Dharma, which means the Eternal Way of Life.
            Indian mythology is a rich tradition of stories about deities and mythological figures. Indian myths are recorded in Hindu texts such as the vedic literature and the Puranas. Hindu mythology as recorded in these texts does not have a consistent narrative or structure. Myths appear in a number of different versions and often evolve over time. Sometimes the name of a character changes or extra details are added. Many Indian myths have been edited over time by the various schools of Hindu philosophy in order to impart a deeper symbolic meaning.
            
            Many Hindus believe in the concept of an Ultimate Reality, which is called Brahman. Brahman is a metaphysical concept of the highest universal principle, which is the first cause of everything that exists. Hindus believe that Brahman is an infinite, eternal truth which causes all changes while remaining itself unchanging. Brahman is the binding unity which underpins the entire universe. Hinduism is a complex set of philosophical and religious beliefs and practices that have emerged from the Indian continent. In the Indian religion of Hinduism, there are hundreds of gods; however, most Hindus do not worship or believe in them all. One of the most important deities in Hinduism is the Trimurti, a triune deity made up of Brahma, the creator, Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer. The Hindu gods are understood to be manifestations of Brahman, the ultimate reality behind everything. In turn, these gods can be manifested as avatars, incarnate in human form.

            There are many texts describing a vast array of Indian mythology and stories about the Hindu gods. The Mahabharata, a long epic poem written in Sanskrit, includes the ''Bhagavad Gita,'' which details a philosophical discussion on the nature of duty that was held between the avatar Krishna and Prince Arjuna. Another epic poem called the Ramayana tells the story of the avatar Rama and how he was able to defeat the demon king Ravana.Indian mythology contains some of the most interesting and complex narratives and characters of the various world mythologies. When we talk about Indian mythology, we are usually referring to the mythology of Hinduism, a major world religion based primarily in India. Its name derives from the name of the Indus River. Long ago, people began calling anyone living on the east side of it ''Indu,'' which later became ''Hindu.'' If you have heard of ''karma,'' you already know a little bit about Hinduism, though the idea of ''what goes around comes around'' is slightly different than Hindu teaching. Hinduism usually emphasizes the goal of moksha, or the release from samsara, the continuous cycle of death and rebirth.

            Many Hindu people believe in multiple gods. If you have heard of Hinduism having 330 million gods, this is true, but it does not mean that each Hindu worships each god. For the most part, Hindu people believe there is one ''ultimate reality,'' which is called Brahman, and the gods, or devas, are manifestations of this divinity. So even though there are many gods, they are all just forms of the same thing, and some of the gods are avatars, or physical manifestations of devas. So Brahman (ultimate reality) is manifested in devas (gods), and the devas are, in turn, physically manifested in avatars, which can be seen.Let's look at some of these figures. Perhaps the most important Hindu gods are those referred to as the Trimurti, which consists of three devas who work together as a whole for the universe. First, there is Brahma, who is the creator god. Brahma created everything, which is then preserved by Vishnu, the protector or preserver god. The third deva, Shiva, is the destroyer god. While this might not sound like a good thing, Shiva is not necessarily concerned with destroying the world, but with destroying the self (helping the Hindu people remove themselves from their desires) and with destroying demons

            Many of the other important Hindu deities are related to the Trimurti. The ''elephant god'' who rides on a mouse is frequently seen in novelty stores with some Indian influence. This god is Ganesha, who is the son of Shiva. Ganesha also is a destroyer, but instead of destroying the world, self, or demons, he destroys obstacles and is seen as a god of fortune and success. No wonder he is so popular!Mahabharata, one of the two Sanskrit epic poems of ancient India (the other being the Ramayana). The Mahabharata is an important source of information on the development of Hinduism between 400 bce and 200 ce and is regarded by Hindus as both a text about dharma (Hindu moral law) and a history (itihasa, literally “that’s what happened”). Appearing in its present form about 400 ce, the Mahabharata consists of a mass of mythological and didactic material arranged around a central heroic narrative that tells of the struggle for sovereignty between two groups of cousins, the Kauravas (sons of Dhritarashtra, the descendant of Kuru) and the Pandavas (sons of Pandu). The poem is made up of almost 100,000 couplets—about seven times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined—divided into 18 parvans, or sections, plus a supplement titled Harivamsha (“Genealogy of the God Hari”; i.e., of Vishnu). Although it is unlikely that any single person wrote the poem, its authorship is traditionally ascribed to the sage Vyasa, who appears in the work as the grandfather of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. The date and even the historical occurrence of the war that is the central event of the Mahabharata are much debated.</p>
